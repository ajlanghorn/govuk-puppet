# Contributing guidelines for GOV.UK's Puppet repository

## Coding in the open vs open source

This repository is [public][coding-open], but it's not supported open
source software. We may not accept contributions if they aren't useful
for GOV.UK or if they introduce operational complexity.

## Pull requests

You can propose changes using a pull request.

1. [Fork the repository][forking] (if you don't have access to push new branches)
2. Create a feature branch to work on (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your work (we like [commits that explain your thought process][commits])
4. Open a pull request
5. If you have write access, you can merge your own pull request once somebody
   has reviewed it and given you a thumbs up üëç. If you don't have access, we'll
   merge the pull request for you once it's ready.

## Tests

Our tests run on Travis (for all pull requests) and on our own Jenkins
instance (from branches in the alphagov GitHub organisation).

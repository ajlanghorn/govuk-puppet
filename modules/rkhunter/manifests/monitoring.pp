# == Class: rkhunter::monitoring
#
# Nagios check to ensure that the definition update has been run by the
# weekly cronjob. This is subtley different from checking that the
# definitions have actually been updated, but it's the best we can do
# because:
#
# - The `--versioncheck` argument only checks the installed version of
#   rkhunter (which comes from Ubuntu packages) and not the updates.
# - The `--update` argument will provide information about updates. But it's
#   not idempotent, in the respect that it will also trigger the update.
# - The actual definition files don't update often enough to second guess
#   their frequency. Some for version 1.3 are currently 2 years old.
#
# The mirrors database does get updated on every run, so we use it's mtime
# as an indication whether the cronjob has been running. To avoid using sudo
# we give the nagios user read permissions on the DB directory so that it
# can stat() the files within. There is a dependency on icinga::client for
# the creation of that GID.

  # Provides:
  # - `notify-reboot-required` which is referenced in the `postinst`
  #   of some packages in order to request that the system be rebooted at a
  #   convenient time. Required by the `check_reboot_required` alert, but
  #   still beneficial to have on nodes that aren't monitored by Nagios.
  # - `apt-check` which is called by the `check_apt_security_updates` alert.
  #   More reliable than the builtin Nagios plugin.

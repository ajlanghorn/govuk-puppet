# == Define: govuk::app
#
# Configure an app server to run this app. Sets up everything necessary
# including Nginx, log collection, upstart jobs, environment variables etc.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*app_type*] 'rack', 'procfile', or 'bare'.
#
# An app_type of 'rack' will assume the presence of a `config.ru` file in
# the root of the deployed application, and will run the rack up under
# unicorn.
#
# An app_type of 'procfile' will assume the presence of a `Procfile` in the
# root of the deployed application, which defines a 'web' process type.
#
# An app_type of 'bare' will use the string passed to the `command`
# parameter to start the application. For cases where a `Procfile` is
# unnecessary.
#
#
# [*port*]
# internal HTTP port for the application.
#
# If the `app_type` is rack, the -P option will be passed to unicorn
# automatically. If the `app_type` is 'procfile', then the command run by
# the Procfile MUST listen on the port defined by the 'PORT' environment
# variable.
#
# Optional, if the `app_type` is 'bare'.
#
#
# [*command*]
# command to start the application
#
# Used when `app_type` is 'bare'. This will be passed to a variable called
# `GOVUK_APP_CMD` which is used by `govuk_spinup`.
#
#
# [*create-pidfile*]
# Determines whether a pidfile is created when a `procfile` app is started
#
# By default procfile apps will create pid files (via the --make-pid switch
# in govuk_spinup).
# If the create-pidfile value is set to false, then a pid file will not be
# created.  This is appropriate when using unicornherder with gunicorn.
# The value defaults to 'NOTSET' (as opposed to true) to try to flag up that
# this doesn't apply to all app types. (eg Rack apps don't create pid files
# by default)
#
#
# [*logstream*]
# choose whether or not to create a log tailing upstart job
#
# If set present, logstream upstart job will be created for a selection of
# logs we care about.
#
#
# [*legacy_logging*]
# Whether to support the legacy logging scheme where we collect application
# logs directly, instead of having logs log to stdout/stderr.
# Default: true
#
#
# [*log_format_is_json*]
# Whether the legacy application logs are in JSON format. If set to true,
# logstream will consume this as a logstash JSON event formatted stream.
#
# This is ignored unless legacy_logging is set to true.
#
# Default: false
#
#
# [*health_check_path*]
# path at which to check the status of the application.
#
# This is used to export health checks to ensure the application is running
# correctly.
#
#
# [*expose_health_check*]
# whether to expose the health check to the proxy.
#
# In some apps, such as bouncer, this must be exposed so load balancers know
# whether to send requests to a particular server; in other apps, such as
# publisher, this must not be exposed, because then it would provide an
# uncached, unauthenticated, publicly accessible point of access into the
# state of our admin systems.
#
#
# [*json_health_check*]
# whether the app's health check is exposed as JSON.
#
# Some of our apps are adopting a JSON-based healthcheck convention, where
# there is an overall `status` field that summarises the health of the app,
# and a `checks` dictionary with the results of individual app-level checks.
# Setting this to true will add a monitoring check that the healthcheck
# reports the app's status as OK.
#
#
# [*intercept_errors*]
# should nginx intercept application errors
#
# If set to true, the nginx fronting the application will intercept
# application errors and serve default error pages
#
#
# [*deny_framing*]
# should we allow this app to be framed
#
# If set to true, the nginx fronting the app will set the X-Frame-Options
# header in such a way as to deny framing in clients that support the header.
#
#
# [*enable_nginx_vhost*]
# should this app be fronted by nginx?
#
# Boolean: true or false
#
#
# [*vhost*]
# the virtual host prefix for this app
#
# Defaults to $title, the name of your application.
#
# The app will be served at "$vhost.$app_domain".
#
#
# [*vhost_aliases*]
# other vhosts on which your app is served
#
# Use of this parameter is discouraged: there should preferably be one and
# only one home for your application. Moreover, all apps are served from a
# common namespace, and the more names an app has, the greater the chances
# of a namespace collision.
#
#
# [*vhost_protected*]
# should this vhost be protected with HTTP Basic auth?
#
# Boolean: true or false
#
# Default: false
#
#
# [*vhost_ssl_only*]
# should this app be served exclusively over HTTPS
#
# Boolean: true or false
#
#
# [*nginx_extra_config*]
# additional nginx configuration for this app
#
# This parameter can be used to supply additional nginx configuration
# directives to be included in your application. In general, use of this
# parameter indicates that your app is doing something "special", and we
# should be striving for an infrastructure that contains the smallest
# possible number of "special cases". As such, use of this option is
# discouraged, and it is included for backwards compatibility purposes only.
#
#
# [*nginx_extra_app_config*]
# additional @app block configuration
#
# This parameter is used to add additional logic (like proxy
# fallback behaviour) to the default downstream proxy functionality
# used in Nginx.
#
#
# [*nagios_cpu_warning*]
# percentage at which Nagios should generate a warning
#
# This parameter is used to change the threshold of the exported nagios
# cpu usage check. It defaults to 150% for a warning and does not generally
# need to be altered.
#
#
# [*nagios_cpu_critical*]
# percentage at which Nagios should generate a critical
#
# This parameter is used to change the threshold of the exported nagios
# cpu usage check. It defaults to 200% for a critical and does not generally
# need to be altered.
#
#
# [*nagios_memory_warning*]
# memory use at which Nagios should generate a warning
#
# This parameter is used to change the threshold of the exported nagios
# memory check. It defaults to 2GB for a warning and does not generally
# need to be altered. Default is `undef` so we can explicitly pass `undef`
# to use the default value.
#
#
# [*nagios_memory_critical*]
# memory use at which Nagios should generate a critical
#
# This parameter is used to change the threshold of the exported nagios
# memory check. It defaults to 3GB for a critical and does not generally
# need to be altered. Default is `undef` so we can explicitly pass `undef`
# to use the default value.
#
# [*alert_5xx_warning_rate*]
# the 5xx error percentage that should generate a warning
#
# [*alert_5xx_critical_rate*]
# the 5xx error percentage that should generate a critical
#
# [*unicorn_herder_timeout*]
# the timeout (in seconds) period to wait for
#
# Provides a way to override the default wait period for the 'failed to
# daemonize' error that occurs if an application doesn't load within
# the timeout period.
#
#
# [*upstart_post_start_script*]
# an optional script to be added to a post-start
# stanza in the upstart config.
#
#
# [*asset_pipeline*]
# should we enable some asset pipeline specific rules in the
# nginx config.
#
#
# [*asset_pipeline_prefix*]
# the path prefix from which assets are served.  This should
# match the application's config.assets.prefix (which defaults to 'assets')
#
#
# [*ensure*]
# allow govuk app to be removed.
#
#
# [*depends_on_nfs*]
# Start the application after mounted filesystems. Some applications
# depend on NFS shares for functionality. They should not start until the mounted
# filesystem has been connected. The default for this is false.
#
#
# [*read_timeout*]
# Configure the amount of time the nginx proxy vhost will wait for the
# backing app before it sends the client a 504. It defaults to 15 seconds.
#
